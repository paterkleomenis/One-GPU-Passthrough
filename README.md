GPU Passthrough on Linux
Overview
This repository provides a comprehensive guide to setting up GPU passthrough on Linux systems. GPU passthrough allows a virtual machine (VM) to directly access the host's GPU, enabling high-performance graphics rendering in a VM environment. This is particularly useful for tasks like gaming, 3D rendering, and running GPU-intensive applications in a virtualized setup.
